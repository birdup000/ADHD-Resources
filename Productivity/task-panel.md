# ADHD Task Panel

The ADHD Task Panel is a React Native application designed to help individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) manage their tasks and stay organized. ADHD can make it challenging to maintain focus, prioritize tasks, and keep track of deadlines. This app aims to address these challenges by providing a user-friendly and ADHD-friendly interface to help users stay on top of their responsibilities.

## Mission

The mission of the ADHD Task Panel is to empower individuals with ADHD to regain control over their tasks and improve their productivity. ADHD can make it difficult to stay organized and focused, leading to missed deadlines, forgotten tasks, and a sense of constant overwhelm. The ADHD Task Panel aims to alleviate these challenges by providing a visually appealing, distraction-free environment where users can easily create, edit, and track their tasks.

The app's features, such as the ability to associate tasks with GitHub repositories, visual cues for past-due tasks, and the ability to manage subtasks, are designed to cater to the unique needs of individuals with ADHD. By providing a structured and intuitive task management system, the ADHD Task Panel empowers users to regain control over their workload, reduce stress, and improve their overall well-being.
